    - Compatibility: This product would most likely interact with software like Twitch integration.
      Architecture would have to be compatible with that i.e twitch embedds/chat. 
    
    - Product Lifetime: Can continuously add new features as time goes on, so we would need to make
     the architecutre evolvable.
